<p>JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However Java is platform independent.</p>

<h4 id="jvm">JVM</h4>
<p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in Which Java bytecode can be executed.
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.</p>

<p>JVMs are availbale for many hardware and software platforms.</p>

<p>The JVM performs the following main tasks :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loads code</li>
  <li>Verifies code</li>
  <li>Executes code</li>
  <li>Provides runtime environment</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="jre">JRE</h4>
<p>JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.</p>

<h4 id="jdk">JDK</h4>

<p>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets.
It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.</p>
