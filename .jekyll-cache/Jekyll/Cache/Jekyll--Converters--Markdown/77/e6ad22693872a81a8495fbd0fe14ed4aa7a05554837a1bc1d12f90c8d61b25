<p>This room is a small vulnerable web application. In the [OWASP Juice shop], we looked at how some basic vulnerabilities worked. In this room, we’ll walk though the methodology and approach of testing a web application. As an ethical hacker, you need to test the web application from the perspective of an attacker. We’ll be using this mindset to establish a strategy to look for weaknesses in the web application.</p>
