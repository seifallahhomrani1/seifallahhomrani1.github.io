### What is Github 
I will not tell you what is Github, if you don't know what the hell is it, GTFO of here!
 
### Links 
Follow this [Link](https://education.github.com/pack), go sign for the education pack, It may gets a week or even more to get verified (In my case, it lasts about 3 weeks, I was hella checking my mail everyday, literally everyday!)

### Why ? 
Well, It depends, let me tell you how I used the education pack : 
- I host this website using Github Pages in a Private Repository with enforced HTTPS (Available only in the PRO Vers.) and I got the domain name [seifallahhomrani1.social](https://seifallahhomrani1.social) FREELY ! Cool hein ? 
- [JETBRAINS](https://jetbrains.com), which offers Professional desktop IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and more, you can use these IDEs for you programming projects, they're so fancy! 
- [Unity](https://unity.com), The king of gaming delevopment plus Student Plan which offers alot of cool stuff. That would be great! 
- [repl.it](https://repl.it), my lovely boy; I write code, anywhere, anytime and it runs! Oh Heaven! I even host it to solve some CTFs which requires running webpages, easy-peasy ! 
- [Pageclip](https://pageclip.co), A server for your static websites and HTML forms. well that looks interesting, I may use it in the future. 


### Final thoughts 
Getting this kind of deals is not an everyday thing! Don't waste it !
