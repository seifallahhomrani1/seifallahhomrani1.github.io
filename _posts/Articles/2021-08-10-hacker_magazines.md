Phrack magazine, published electronically, is the equivalent of a popular trade magazine geared towards computer hackers. Described by Fyodor - the Nmap creator - as "the best, and by far the longest running hacker zine,"
Later shut down and then resurrected, Phrack editors decide which submissions should be published. Although number 63 was supposed to be its last issue, Phrack 69 was released in May 2016.

Phrack, first released on November 17, 1985, takes its name from the words "phreak" and "hack". The founding editors of the magazine, known by the pseudonyms "Taran King" and "Knight Lightning", edited most of the first 30 editions.
