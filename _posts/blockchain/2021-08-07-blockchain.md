## Introduction

According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain):
**Blockchain defined**: Blockchain is a *shared*, *immutable ledger* that facilitates the process of *recording* transactions and *tracking* assets in a business network. An asset can be *tangible* (a house, car, cash, land) or *intangible* (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, *reducing risk* and cutting costs for all involved.

**Why blockchain is important**: Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides *immediate*, *shared* and *completely transparent* information stored on an *immutable ledger* that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

## Where can we apply Blockchain technology?

### Food Safety - Walmart
Walmart has been working with [IBM and Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/walmart-case-study) for over a year on using the blockchain to **digitize the food supply chain process**. In fact, supply chain is one of the premiere business use cases for blockchain (beyond digital currency). Walmart is using the IBM Food Trust Solution, specifically developed for this use case.

“We built the IBM Food Trust solution using IBM Blockchain Platform, which is a tool or capability that IBM has built to help companies build, govern and run blockchain networks. It’s built using Hyperledger Fabric (the open source digital ledger technology) and it runs on IBM Cloud,” Bridget van Kralingen, IBM’s senior VP for Global Industries, Platforms and Blockchain explained.

### Document Signing

With blockchain, you can imagine a world in which documents are embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision. [https://mydocuments.tn/] is a Tunisian solution made by [ATI](https://www.ati.tn/) and [UniversaBlockchain](https://universablockchain.com/) collaboration.

### Supply Chain

[Singapore-based VeChain](https://www.vechain.org/) created a permissioned blockchain-based supply chain to monitor products as they move along from manufacturer to store shelf.

## Blockchain Demo
This is a very basic visual introduction to the concepts behind a blockchain by [Anders Brownworth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx7YSpyYtgaYik1Wen9jYSA) introduce the idea of an immutable ledger using an interactive web demo.

This is part two in my basic visual introduction to the concepts behind a blockchain. We build on the concepts from the previous video and introduce public / private key pairs and signing using an interactive web demo.
