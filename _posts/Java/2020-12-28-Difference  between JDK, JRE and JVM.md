Notes: 

JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However Java is platform independent.

#### JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in Which Java bytecode can be executed.
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

JVMs are availbale for many hardware and software platforms. 

The JVM performs the following main tasks : 

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

#### JRE 
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.


#### JDK

JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets.
It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.
